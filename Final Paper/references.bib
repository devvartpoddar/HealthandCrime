abstract = {IMPORTANCE The Affordable Care Act is the most important health care legislation enacted in the United States since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The lawimplemented comprehensive reforms designed to improve the accessibility, affordability, and quality of health care. OBJECTIVES To review the factors influencing the decision to pursue health reform, summarize evidence on the effects of the lawto date, recommend actions that could improve the health care system, and identify general lessons for public policy from the Affordable Care Act. EVIDENCE Analysis of publicly available data, data obtained from government agencies, and published research findings. The period examined extends from 1963 to early 2016. FINDINGS The Affordable Care Act has made significant progress toward solving long-standing challenges facing the US health care system related to access, affordability, and quality of care. Since the Affordable Care Act became law, the uninsured rate has declined by 43{\%}, from 16.0{\%}in 2010to 9.1{\%}in 2015, primarily because of the law's reforms. Research has documented accompanying improvements in access to care (for example, an estimated reduction in the share of nonelderly adults unable to afford care of 5.5 percentage points), financial security (for example, an estimated reduction in debts sent to collection of {\$}600-{\$}1000 per person gaining Medicaid coverage), and health (for example, an estimated reduction in the share of nonelderly adults reporting fair or poor health of 3.4 percentage points). The lawhas also begun the process of transforming health care payment systems, with an estimated30{\%}of traditional Medicare payments nowflowing through alternative payment models like bundled payments or accountable care organizations. These and related reforms have contributed to a sustained period of slowgrowth in per-enrollee health care spending and improvements in health care quality. Despite this progress, major opportunities to improve the health care system remain. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Policy makers should build on progress made by the Affordable Care Act by continuing to implement the Health Insurance Marketplaces and delivery system reform, increasing federal financial assistance for Marketplace enrollees, introducing a public plan option in areas lacking individual market competition, and taking actions to reduce prescription drug costs. Although partisanship and special interest opposition remain, experience with the Affordable Care Act demonstrates that positive change is achievable on some of the nation's most complex challenges.},
